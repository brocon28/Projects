Memory Allocator Simulator (Heap Manager)
Overview
This project simulates a simple custom memory allocator, implementing core functionalities similar to malloc and free using C++. The goal is to deepen understanding of pointers, dynamic memory management, and low-level system operations by building a heap manager from scratch.

Features
-Custom malloc and free simulation: Allocate and deallocate memory blocks within a simulated heap.
-Free list management: Track and manage free memory blocks to optimize allocation.
-Block splitting and coalescing: Efficiently handle fragmentation by splitting larger blocks or merging adjacent free blocks.
-Bonus: Basic debugging features including memory leak detection to identify unfreed allocations.
