# Replit C++ Template for Programming Quiz 4

This is a Replit IDE template preloaded with the Bridges C++ library containing instructions for Programming Quiz 4.

More information about the Bridges project can be found [here](http://bridgesuncc.github.io/index.html).
The Bridges C++ library documentation can be found [here](http://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/cxx-api/current/html/index.html).

When the Bridges library is updated, this repository should be updated shortly thereafter (if necessary).

## Overview

This assignment will give you exposure to the Bridges API, which provides access to real data sets and tools for data structure visualization. 

In this assignment, you will create an interactive visualization of a Binary Search Tree (BST) containing data from any Bridges data set. You are given a sample Bridges BST insert function which you can use to construct your tree.

You will need to import any Bridges data set, insert the data into a Bridges BST, and color the nodes in the tree using a level-order traversal. You will then make an API request to create a visualization for your colorful tree.

Completing this assignment will develop your skills in working with binary trees and external APIs over the Internet.
