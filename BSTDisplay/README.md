# Programming Quiz 4 - Trees ðŸŒ³

This project implements a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** using the [Bridges API](https://bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/).  
It uses real-world game data, inserts it into the BST, and colors the nodes by level using a **level-order traversal** (BFS).  
The tree is then visualized remotely through the Bridges platform.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Builds a BST using game ratings as keys and game titles as values.
- Imports real-world data from the Bridges `Game` dataset.
- Performs level-order traversal (BFS) to color nodes by level.
- Each level is assigned a unique color (no two consecutive levels share the same color).
- Visualizes the BST online using Bridges.

## ðŸ“¸ Visualization
Hereâ€™s what the final BST visualization looks like (colors by level):
